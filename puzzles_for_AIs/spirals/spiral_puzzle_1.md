Goal : create a spiral out of red element, in a white matrix 5 by 5. 

The target image should be: 
```

ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¥â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œ
```

The code should start by placing a dot in the middle of the matrix and then show the progress of the spiral as this: 
```
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ

â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ

â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ

â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ

ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ

```
Notice the white spaces retained by that algorithm: half the resulting shape remains white: there is a red spiral and white spiral at the end. 


Now, you have the beginning of  code :

`def print_spiral(n):
    emoji_list = ["ğŸŸ¥", "â¬œ"]`
....
and the likely end: 
`final_output_red_white_spiral = display_spiral(spiral_matrix)`


which will display that string variable as final Result. 

Task: create the code that does so.
