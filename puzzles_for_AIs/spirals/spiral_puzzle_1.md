Goal : create a spiral out of red element, in a white matrix 5 by 5. 

The target image should be: 
```

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥
🟥⬜⬜⬜⬜
🟥⬜🟥🟥⬜
🟥⬜⬜🟥⬜
🟥🟥🟥🟥⬜
```

The code should start by placing a dot in the middle of the matrix and then show the progress of the spiral as this: 
```
⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜
⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜
⬜ ⬜ 🟥 ⬜ ⬜
⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜
⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜

⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜
⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜
⬜ ⬜ 🟥 🟥 ⬜
⬜ ⬜ ⬜ 🟥 ⬜
⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜

⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜
⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜
⬜ ⬜ 🟥 🟥 ⬜
⬜ ⬜ ⬜ 🟥 ⬜
⬜ 🟥 🟥 🟥 ⬜

⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜
🟥 ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜
🟥 ⬜ 🟥 🟥 ⬜
🟥 ⬜ ⬜ 🟥 ⬜
🟥 🟥 🟥 🟥 ⬜

🟥 🟥 🟥 🟥 🟥
🟥 ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜
🟥 ⬜ 🟥 🟥 ⬜
🟥 ⬜ ⬜ 🟥 ⬜
🟥 🟥 🟥 🟥 ⬜

```
Notice the white spaces retained by that algorithm: half the resulting shape remains white: there is a red spiral and white spiral at the end. 


Now, you have the beginning of  code :

`def print_spiral(n):
    emoji_list = ["🟥", "⬜"]`
....
and the likely end: 
`final_output_red_white_spiral = display_spiral(spiral_matrix)`


which will display that string variable as final Result. 

Task: create the code that does so.
