Goal : create a spiral out of red element, in a white matrix 5 by 5. 

The target image should be: 

ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¥â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œ

The code should start from the middle and show thus this: 
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ

â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ

â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ

â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ

ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ â¬œ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¥ â¬œ


Now, you have the beginning of  code :

`def print_spiral(n):
    emoji_list = ["ğŸŸ¥", "â¬œ"]`
....
and the likely end: 
final_output_red_white_spiral = display_spiral(spiral_matrix)

which will display that string variable as final Result. 


Good luck!
